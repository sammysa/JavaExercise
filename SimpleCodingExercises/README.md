# Technical Scenarios

You have 2 Java technical questions to test your coding abilities - give me the solutions to both the scenarios below
-	Give a String of characters, write a method that will not only detect which character occurs the most in the String but also how many times it occurs. Give an output of both the character and the number of times it occurs
-	Give an array our integer number, find the 2nd highest value in the array
Tip – use collections for both these scenarios
